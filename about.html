    <p>I got my start programming in High School, and took that fascination with making things work to the Georgia 
    Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a Bacehlor of Science in Computational Media.</p>
    <p>After graduating, I decided to go a slightly different route than my peers, and went into the United States 
    Marine Corps.  After being accepted into and graduating Officer Candidate School, I was commissioned a Second 
    Lieutenant in 2011.  From there, I continued my initial Marine Corps Education at The Basic School and the Basic 
    Communications Officer Course, and went on to serve at the "Mighty" 7th Communication Battalion in Okinawa, Japan.</p>
    <p>I received an Honorable Discharge in 2015 and am now pursuing opportunities in the civilian world, while 
    continuing to serve as a member of the Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
    <p>I speak English and Japanese, and I occupy my spare time with programming, reading, video games, Warhammer 40k, 
    lifting weights, and SCUBA diving.</p>
    <p>My education in programming and experience leading teams of technical professionals combine to make me ideally 
    suited to managing technical projects, as well as to working as a member of technical teams.</p>
    <p>This space serves to showcase some of the personal programming projects I've pursued in my free-time. Please take a look, 
    and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!<br/>-Peter</p>
